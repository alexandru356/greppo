# Greppo

**Greppo** is a simple and efficient command-line tool written in Go that searches for text patterns in files and directories â€” similar to Unix `grep`, but with a minimal and clean Go implementation.

Use it for quick pattern matching, recursive search, and filtering lines in files with useful flags like case-insensitivity, line counting, and more.
